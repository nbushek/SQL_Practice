The SparkSQL_Exercises notebook contains some exercises I did for a Pyspark Coursera course. The SQL tasks themselves are pretty easy, the last exercise being a little more complicated with the use of a subquery. One interesting aspect of this exercise, though, was that the Spark csv read command parsed some of the string variables incorrectly. Detecting this, and fixing it, was a good exercise in data wrangling/cleaning.
